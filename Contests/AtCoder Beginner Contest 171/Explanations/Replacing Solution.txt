In this problem there is game of frequency of the integers if you observe. We have given some integers and what we need to do in
each query replace the first given integer to the second given integer make sure that all the occurrences of the first integer
should be changed with the given second integer. Then output the sum of all the integers of the array for each query.

So what I did here is that I take a frequency array and count the occurrences of all the integers of the array.
And take the sum of all the integers of the original given array. Then for each query I multiply the second given integer with the
frequency of the first given integer(which we need to replace), so that the number of times second integer came will added to the
original sum. Now we need to need to minus the sum of those integers which was replaced for doing so multiply the frequency of the
first integer with the first integer and minus it from the sum and make sure to update the frequency of the integers after the changes.
Make the frequency of second integer the frequency of first integer and make the frequency of first integer zero. Output the sum.
