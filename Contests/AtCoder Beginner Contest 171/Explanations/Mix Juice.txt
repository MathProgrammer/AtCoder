In this problem we have given the prices of N types of fruits and we need to choose K types of food
such that they cost minimum possible.

So, here we need to do sort the array so that we got prices in ascending order. Since we need to bought K kinds of
fruits, so sum up first K prices and we got needed output.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n,k;						// n is the kind of foods and k is the kind of food we need to choose such that the condition holds
    cin>>n>>k;						// Input take place
    int price[n+1];						// Array for the price
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    cin>>price[i];
    sort(price,price+n);			// Sort the array
    int sum=0;						// Take sum and intialize it to zero
    for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
    sum+=price[i];						// Sum of first k kind of foods that costs minimum possible
    cout<<sum<<endl;				// Output the answer
    return 0;
}
