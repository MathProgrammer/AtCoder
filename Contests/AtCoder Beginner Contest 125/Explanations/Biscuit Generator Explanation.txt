Biscuits are only produced at integer points so we need not worry about + 0.5
There are (T/A) different time intervals. 
Each interval contributes B 

Total biscuits = (T/A)B 

The order of operations should be correct 

-----

int main()
{
    int A, B, T;
    cin >> A >> B >> T;

    int total = (T/A)*B;
    cout << total << "\n";

    return 0;
}
