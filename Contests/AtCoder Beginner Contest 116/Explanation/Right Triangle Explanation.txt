The area of a right triangle is (base x height)/2 

It is guaranteed that the area of the triangle is an integer in this problem so we don't need to handle floating points 

------

int main()
{
    int height, base, hypotenuse;
    cin >> height >> base >> hypotenuse;

    int area = (height*base)/2;
    cout << area << "\n";

    return 0;
}
